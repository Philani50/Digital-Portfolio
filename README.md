##  About Me

I'm Philani Shange, an enthusiastic and dedicated student currently pursuing a Diploma in Information and Communication Technology at Cape Peninsula University of Technology. I specialize in application development with a strong passion for building impactful and innovative software solutions.

My interests span across Internet of Things (IoT), web development, and data-driven applications—fields where I enjoy blending creativity with logic. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can tackle complex problems and turn them into practical, user-focused solutions.

From developing sleek user interfaces to coding embedded systems and smart technologies, I'm constantly learning and pushing myself to create tech that makes life smarter, faster, and easier. My goal is to not only grow as a developer but to contribute meaningfully to communities through technology.
